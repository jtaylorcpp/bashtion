# What & Why

There are a ton of CM projects... Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt...

However, they all suck in their own special ways. The common problem between them all 
is that they are based on DSLs, downloadable modules, and make many more asbtractions than necessary.

And, on top of that; how many operating systems does a group usually run? A small dev shop? Maybe 2.

How about containers? Rarely are there tools that can be used to build containers and
 provision cloud instances.

In fact, for a straight forward system... why do tools drive users from just using BASH?

Bashtion is a very simple CM solution based on BASH. In many ways; this is what makes
 the most sense for the DevOps and IT shops.
